# APECS_DM
Repository to work on data management of the fish seine data associated with the large, interdisciplinary project APECS. Fish seines are from multiple years, but similar data checking and data conversions happen with each data set. 
This repository has several roles

- data checking (QA/QC) of fish seine data
- calculate fork_length/total_length of unmeasured fish based on measured fish distribution
- convert fork_length/total_length to biomass based on species
- finialize data sets for uploading to KNB data repository
